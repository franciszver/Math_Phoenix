# The Math Academy Way – Working Draft

This document outlines Math Academy's philosophy and technical approach to mathematical talent development, rooted in modern cognitive science and optimized through technology.

## I. Core Philosophy and The Problem to Solve

### Chapter 1. The Two-Sigma Solution
- **Bloom's Two-Sigma Problem**: One-on-one tutoring produced outcomes **two standard deviations** above traditional classroom teaching. The challenge: achieve this effect at scale and low cost.
- **Traditional Schooling**: Groups by age, progresses in lockstep, expects differing achievement.
- **Talent Development (Math Academy Way)**: Individualized, mastery-based, progress measured by advanced skills executed to threshold.
- **Cost of Talent Development**: Human coaching ≈ $13,000/year. Math Academy reduces to **$499/year** (26x cheaper) via technology.
- **Bloom's 3-Stage Process**: Focus on **Middle Developmental Years** (skill refinement & mastery).
- **Misinterpreted Taxonomy**: Foundational skills must be front-loaded before higher-level creative production.

### Chapter 2. The Science of Learning
- **Evidence-Based Strategies**: Active Learning, Deliberate Practice, Mastery Learning, Minimizing Cognitive Load, Automaticity, Layering, Non-Interference, Spaced Repetition, Testing Effect, Targeted Remediation, Gamification.
- **Persistence of Tradition**: Effective strategies avoided because they feel harder.
- **Desirable Difficulty vs. Illusion of Comprehension**: Effortful practice improves recall; easy practice creates false mastery.
- **Learning Acceleration**: Math Academy accelerates learning **4x** (AP Calculus BC: ~6,000 XP vs. ~24,000 minutes in school).

### Chapter 3. Core Science: How the Brain Works
- **Cognition Pipeline**: Sensory Memory → Working Memory (WM) → Long-Term Memory (LTM).
- **WM Limit**: ~4 chunks for ~20 seconds.
- **Learning as Wiring**: Consolidation creates neural pathways.
- **Goal of Instruction**: Expand LTM, mitigate WM bottleneck.

## II. Addressing Critical Misconceptions

### Chapter 7. Myths & Realities about Individual Differences
- **Learning Style Myth**: No evidence for “preferred learning styles.”
- **Learning Speed Reality**: Differences stem from Working Memory Capacity (WMC).
- **Mathematical Potential**: Effort vs. level is exponential; efficiency flattens curve.
- **All Can Learn Some, Few Can Learn All**: Talent affects speed, but deliberate practice is essential.

### Chapter 8. Myths & Realities about Effective Practice
- **Expertise Reversal Effect**: Discovery learning helps experts, harms novices.
- **Direct Instruction**: Best for beginners; unguided = misconceptions.
- **Effort Required**: Low-effort strategies ineffective; testing & spaced repetition crucial.
- **Computation**: Builds fluency and conceptual understanding.

### Chapter 9. Myths & Realities about Mathematical Acceleration
- **Developmental Appropriateness**: Acceleration safe if prerequisites mastered.
- **Depth of Learning**: Accelerated students learn as deeply, just faster.
- **Running Out of Courses**: Beyond Calculus BC lies Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, etc.
- **Higher-Grade Math > Competition Problems**: Advanced courses more useful than niche contest problems.

## III. Math Academy's Cognitive Learning Strategies (The Technology)

### Chapter 4. Core Technology: The Knowledge Graph
- **Knowledge Graph (KG)**: Organizes thousands of topics with prerequisite relationships.
- **Knowledge Frontier**: Lessons only at the student’s frontier (ZPD).

### Chapter 13. Mastery Learning
- **True Mastery**: Achieved at granular topic level via KG.

### Chapter 14. Minimizing Cognitive Load
- **Micro-Scaffolding**: Tiny steps (Knowledge Points, 10x smaller).
- **Worked Examples**: Schema-building.
- **Dual-Coding Theory**: Visual + verbal channels.

### Chapter 15. Developing Automaticity
- **Automation**: Frees WM for higher thought.
- **Practice & Quizzes**: Enforce fluency and automaticity.

### Chapter 16–17. Layering & Non-Interference
- **Layering**: Move forward immediately upon mastery.
- **Non-Interference**: Teach dissimilar concepts together to avoid confusion.

### Chapter 18. Spaced Repetition
- **FIRe Algorithm**: Fractional Implicit Repetition.
- **Implicit Repetition**: Advanced topics reinforce prerequisites.
- **Calibration**: Reviews timed when memory is “fuzzy.”

### Chapter 20. The Testing Effect
- **Continuous Assessment**: Frequent, interleaved quizzes.
- **Testing & Anxiety**: Low-stakes, growth mindset.

### Chapter 21. Targeted Remediation
- **High-Integrity Remediation**: Pinpointed to prerequisite skills.
- **Corrective Flow**: Fail twice → remedial reviews → retry.

### Chapter 22. Gamification
- **XP System**: 1 XP ≈ 1 minute of focused work.
- **Incentives**: Pace, quality, penalties for guessing.

## IV. Technical Deep Dives and Practical Application

### Chapter 29. Spaced Repetition Deep Dive
- **FIRe Mechanism**: Success flows down, failure flows up.
- **Repetition Compression**: One advanced review covers many prerequisites.

### Chapter 31. Learning Efficiency
- **Performance vs. Work**: Efficiency = progress/time.
- **Pace**: 40 XP/day = 15 weeks per course; 80 XP/day = 7 weeks.

## FAQ: Practice Experience & Student Behavior
- **Note-Taking**: Avoid over-reliance; use paper for intermediate steps.
- **Quizzes**: Interleaved, timed, target 80–85% accuracy.
- **Remediation**: Breaks enforced before retries.

## FAQ: Diagnostics and Curriculum
- **Diagnostic Integrity**: Skip if unsure; ensures accurate placement.
- **Comprehensive Curriculum**: Thousands of lessons, procedural fluency before proofs.
