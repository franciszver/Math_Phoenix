# Math_Phoenix

An **AI-powered math tutor** that guides K‑12 students through problems using **Socratic questioning**.  
Math_Phoenix accepts problems via **text or image upload**, normalizes math into LaTeX, and helps students discover solutions through guided dialogue.  
It also provides a **teacher dashboard** with aggregate and per‑session insights.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>= 18.x recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- AWS account with:
  - S3 bucket
  - Textract enabled
  - DynamoDB tables:
    - `math-phoenix-sessions` (with TTL for 30‑day expiration)
    - `math-phoenix-ml-data` (optional, for ML data collection)
- OpenAI API key (with access to GPT + Vision endpoints)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Math_Phoenix
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install

   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file and fill in your values
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual credentials
   ```

4. Set up AWS resources:
   ```bash
   # See infrastructure/README.md for setup instructions
   cd infrastructure
   # Follow the setup guide
   ```

5. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start backend
   cd backend
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 2: Start frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🛠️ Development

- **Frontend**: Vite + React (runs on http://localhost:5173 by default)
- **Backend**: Express (runs on http://localhost:3001 by default)

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Sessions
- `GET /api/sessions/:code` - Get session details
- `POST /api/sessions` - Create or get existing session

### Problems
- `POST /api/sessions/:code/problems` - Submit problem (text or image)
  - Body: `{ text: "problem text" }` or multipart form with `image` file
  - Returns: Session code, problem ID, tutor message, problem info

### Chat
- `POST /api/sessions/:code/chat` - Send message in conversation
  - Body: `{ message: "student response" }`
  - Returns: Tutor response, conversation context

## 📊 Phase 3: Monitoring & ML Data Collection

### CloudWatch-Ready Logging & Metrics

**Approach:** Structured logging with CloudWatch-ready JSON output in production.

**Why:** 
- **Development**: Human-readable console logs for debugging
- **Production**: JSON-structured logs automatically ingested by CloudWatch Logs
- **Metrics**: Embedded metric events for CloudWatch Metrics (via log parsing or direct API)

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced logger outputs structured JSON in production mode
- OCR/Vision performance metrics tracked:
  - Success/failure rates by source (Textract vs Vision)
  - Confidence scores
  - Latency (milliseconds)
  - Fallback frequency
- All metrics include dimensions (source, environment) for filtering

**Metrics Tracked:**
- `OCR.Attempt` - Total OCR attempts
- `OCR.Success` / `OCR.Failure` - Success/failure counts
- `OCR.Confidence` - Average confidence scores
- `OCR.Latency` - Processing time
- `OCR.Fallback` - Textract → Vision fallback events
- `OCR.Pipeline.Success` - Overall pipeline success rate

**Note:** CloudWatch integration requires AWS IAM permissions and CloudWatch Logs/Metrics configuration. Currently logs to console/CloudWatch Logs (structured JSON). Full CloudWatch Metrics integration can be added later.

### ML Data Collection for Future Difficulty Classifier

**Approach:** Real-time collection of structured training data in separate DynamoDB table.

**Why:**
- **Separate Storage**: ML data persisted independently from session data (different retention needs)
- **Real-time Collection**: Capture data immediately when problems are submitted (accuracy)
- **Teacher Feedback**: Teacher overrides are valuable training signals (mark as `teacher_override: true`)
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract structured features (operation counts, complexity indicators) for ML training
- **Non-blocking**: Collection happens asynchronously - doesn't impact user experience

**Data Collected:**
- **Problem Features**: Text length, operation counts, variable counts, number features, complexity indicators
- **Category Features**: One-hot encoded categories (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, word, multi-step)
- **Student Performance**: Hints used, steps taken, completion status
- **OCR Metadata**: Source, confidence, success status (for image problems)
- **Teacher Corrections**: When teachers manually override tags (valuable training signal)

**Storage:**
- **Table**: `math-phoenix-ml-data` (separate from session table)
- **Structure**: 
  - `record_id`: Unique identifier
  - `raw_data`: Original problem data (flexibility)
  - `features`: Extracted feature vector (ML-ready)
  - `metadata`: Collection metadata (teacher override, OCR info, timestamps)

**Future Use:**
- Train ML classifier to replace rule-based difficulty classification
- Analyze patterns in teacher corrections to improve auto-tagging
- Build confidence scores based on historical performance data

**Note:** ML data table creation is handled via infrastructure scripts. Collection is non-critical (errors logged but don't fail requests).
